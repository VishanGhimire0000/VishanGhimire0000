## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a science student with a strong interest in **technology, programming, and problem-solving**.  
I focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than memorizing them, and I enjoy building small projects to turn theory into practice.

I believe consistent effort and skill-building matter more than short-term results.
